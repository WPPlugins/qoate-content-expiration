== Description ==

= Qoate Content Expiration =

This plugin lets you put certain content between tags, so it will expire after a given date.
You can set the date in an added metabox below the post editor.
After the content has expired it will be replaced with a custom message which you can set individually for each post.

If you want certain content to expire just put it between `[exp]` and `[/exp]` and set a valid expiration date (dd/mm/yy).
After the expiration date your custom expiration message will show up, instead of the original content between the tags.
